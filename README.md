# Walmart - Confidence Interval and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) 📈🛒

Welcome to the **Walmart Confidence Interval and CLT Project**! 🚀 In this project, we explore customer purchase behavior during **Black Friday** at Walmart and utilize statistical techniques like **Confidence Intervals** and the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** to provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making. 📊

## About Walmart 🌍🛍
**Walmart** is one of the world’s largest retail giants, serving over **100 million customers** globally through its extensive network of supercenters, discount department stores, and grocery shops in the United States. 🏬 With a vast customer base, Walmart is always seeking innovative ways to understand and enhance customer shopping experiences. 🌟

## Business Problem 📝🤔
The Walmart management team aims to gain deeper insights into **customer purchase behavior**, especially on **Black Friday**. They are particularly interested in understanding how factors like **gender, age, and marital status** influence spending habits. 🔍

A key question we're investigating:  
**"Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?"** 🛍💳  
For example, imagine **50 million male** and **50 million female** customers – what are their spending habits like? And how can Walmart leverage this information to improve its strategies? 📊🤔

## What Good Looks Like 👍📈
To address Walmart’s business question, we’ll follow these key steps:

### 1. **Data Import & Initial Exploration**
   - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and characteristics.

### 2. **Handling Null Values & Outliers**
   - Detect and handle missing values and outliers using methods such as `boxplots`, the `describe()` function, and `isnull()` checks to ensure clean data.

### 3. **Data Exploration: Gender-Based Spending Analysis**
   - Analyze spending patterns for **50 million male** and **50 million female** customers.
   - Calculate averages and draw meaningful insights from the purchase behavior.

### 4. **Confidence Interval (CI) Calculation**
   - Leverage sample averages to compute the **Confidence Interval (CI)** for population spending averages using **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** principles.
   - Explore different **CI widths** (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%) and compare the results.

### 5. **Conclusions & Actionable Insights**
   - Check for overlap in confidence intervals to determine if there’s a significant difference between male and female spending.
   - Provide actionable insights for Walmart’s decision-making, such as targeted promotions or personalized marketing strategies.

### 6. **Repeat for Other Features**
   - Extend the analysis to other features like **Marital Status** and **Age** to uncover spending behavior differences across customer segments.
